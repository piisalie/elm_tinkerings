Elm Tinkerings
==============
Just a place for me to put tiny Elm things I'm playing with.

## Autocompleter
A really silly autocomplete that was mostly just for fun and not
useful for anything. [Can be tried out here](http://cannot.into.computer/stuff/complete/index.html)

Todo:
- [ ] Actually use the weights.
- [ ] Adjust the weights when a selection is made.
- [ ] Match on more than just an identical substring ( matching chars maybe idk.)
